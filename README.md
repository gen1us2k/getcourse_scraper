## Get course scraper

I wrote this app just for a sake of justice. I bought a course and I had an mismatch of expectations. I bought the course because I tought that I'll have a lifetime access, yet I'll lose the access in one year

So that's why the idea of the app poped up in my mind. The app downloads videos from getcourse.ru like websites

## Running it for you

Open src/main.rs and add categories of parent lectures. The app supports only one level of inheritance. Once you finished with the categories you can simply run
```
cargo run
```
